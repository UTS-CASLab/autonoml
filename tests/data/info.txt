Synthetic histograms of ~1000 two-photon events with 0 to 500 ns temporal separation, used to estimate single-photon source quality parameter g2(0).
Target can either be the individually fitted estimates or the best estimate for the original data with 10000+ events from which the synthetic histograms were bootstrapped.

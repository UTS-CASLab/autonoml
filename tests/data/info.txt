Datasets...
sps/*_sps_quality_1000_events_*

Details...
Synthetic histograms of ~1000 two-photon events with 0 to 500 ns temporal separation, used to estimate single-photon source quality parameter g2(0).
Target can either be the individually fitted estimates or the best estimate for the original data (10000+ events) from which the synthetic histograms were bootstrapped.
Samples are prepared for training/testing.
